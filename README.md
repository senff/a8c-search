## WHAT DOES THIS TOOL DO

The Senffsational A8C Search Portalpage puts a lot of our internal tools on one single page.  This includes (but is not limited to):
- Store Admin
- Network Admin
- Support Guides
- WordPress.com/WooCommerce.com/Jetpack.com documentation
- Woo Extensions Marketplace
- Jetpack Debugger
- Field Guide
- MGS
- Logstash
- Kibana
- Automattic University sites
- Google Translate
- etc. etc. 

Each individual search box can be customized in 3 very basic ways:
- Show or hide completely
- Resize
- Move

This way, you can have a page where you only see the boxes you want to see, in the order/layout/size you want them.

## INSTALLATION:

1. Download https://github.com/Automattic/support-helper-tools/raw/main/automattic-search-tools/Automattic%20Search%20Tool.zip
2. Decompress the .zip file to any location on your hard drive.
3. Open index.html in your browser.
4. Bookmark the file.
5. Searchy search search.

## NOTE:

When you perform a search, the idea is that the search results will be shown in a new browser tab. The first time you do this, you may get a notification (e.g. "_Firefox prevented this site from opening a popup window_"). 
In that case, select **Preferences** and allow the site to open popups. You will need to do this only once.
